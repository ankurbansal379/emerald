title: Hello World: My Introduction
---
I started my career as a web developer, developing several web based interfaces and as development involves a lot of research, I came to know about my inquisitiveness for analytics. I have more than 2 years of work experience as Associate Systems Analyst and my work has involved analyzing IT infrastructure systems environment optimizing process flow using ITIL standards. My interest is in studying and researching new data sets, analyzing, extracting useful insights and then reporting it in professional manner using latest Business intelligence tools like Tableau and Qlikview.

Also, as I have an inclination towards learning new skills and improving my personality. Currently, I am actively looking for Summer internship opportunities as Business Intelligence Intern in order to further challenge myself and become a well-rounded data professional and IT consultant.
